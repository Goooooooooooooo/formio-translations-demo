    <h2>Platform Resource</h2>
    <p>
      Formio.js uses i18n, a lightweight translation module, to allow users to pass in a translation option during form construction.
      During this process, users can hook into a form.io resource that contains a custom translation object.
      The result, an <code>in-portal interface</code> that can control language translations.
