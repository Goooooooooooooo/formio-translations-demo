      If you are viewing this application via the our hosted service at
      <a href="https://apps.form.io/translations/#/">apps.form.io/translations</a> then the edit mode will be
      locked behind our Form.io PhraseApp account. To experience the integration yourself, please download this application
      <a href="https://github.com/formio/formio-translations-demo">here</a> and replace the <code>projectId</code>
      and <code>accessToken</code> placeholders with your own to get started.

      If you are not sure how to do this, we've created a detailed <a href="https://help.form.io/tutorials/walkthroughs/phraseapp/">walk-though here</a>
      that goes over creating just this portion of the application. Feel free to antiquate yourself with
      <a href="https://help.form.io/tutorials/walkthroughs/phraseapp/#building">PhraseApp Interface</a> specifically as
      that particular section shows how to setup and retrieve the tokens you'll need.
